# Essentia
A second attempt at a document editing app

# Outline
I am thinking that we use a content editable div rather than a text area like i did in my previous attempt. and in here we can add formatting support. it also makes it stupid easy to save the document as a html file which we will do in indexdb so i dont have to worry about a server for the immediate future.
